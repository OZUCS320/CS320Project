 There is still imbalanced workload distribution. 
 Beda should provide more contribution for the documents; more than just the introductory sections. 
 + Section 2.2: These tests are not unit tests; no code will be written for these tests. 
 Test cases include tests steps that are written from the user point of view and describe how the system is used from outside 
 and what output should be observed at the end. Word, Office, Argo UML are all irrelevant.
 + For the same reason, database tests are also not relevant. The goal is to test system functions as a whole.
 We do not consider internal details at the moment.
 + Section 2.3: introduce the admin user to the database? Otherwise how will you start testing?
 + There should be a test case for each system requirement. Operator actions must be step by step and dedicated for testing a feature. 
 So, such a description for operator actions is not acceptable: “Performing all admin functions for e.g. searching a book,
 searching a student, adding a new book.”
 A test case can include: login as admin -> search an existing book ; outcome: see that book appears in the list of results.
 Another test case: login as admin -> search a missing book ; outcome: see a message like no such a book was found. 
 Another one: login as admin -> display the list of students
